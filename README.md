# Image-Segementation-WIth-Clusters
This script performs image segmentation using K-Means clustering. It allows users to upload an image, processes it, and segments it into 6 color clusters. The output is a segmented image with a legend showing the dominant colors. It uses OpenCV for image handling, scikit-learn for clustering and Matplotlib for visualization
